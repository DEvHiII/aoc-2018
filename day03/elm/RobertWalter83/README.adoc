== Solution written in elm 0.19

goto https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html to find your elm installation guide

to build:

    elm make src/Main.elm

This should produce index.html in the root directory, which you can open locally (also checked in for convenience).

== Solution

The input is a string.

=== Part 1

These are the steps of my solution:

  . Step: parse the lines using a regex and remember the four relevant number
  . Step: calulate the bottom right corner of the sheet according to the claims (everything beyond the most bottom / right claim is irrelevant)
  . Step: initialize a dictionary of the size of the grid
  . for each claim, convert the 2D coordinates into 1D coordinates
  . use the coordinate as lookup key in the dictionary and increment the value by 1
  . count all values that are greater than 1

=== Part 2

Pending.

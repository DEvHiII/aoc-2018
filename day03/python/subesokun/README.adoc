== Part 1

For part 1 I'm going to create a map of fabric pieces where the fabric piece coordinate is the item key and a list of claim IDs for that particular fabric piece the item value.

The solution gets calculated by simply looping over the fabric pieces map and counting all pieces that have two or more claims.

== Part 2

For part 2 an additional map gets created to identify the claims that have no overlaps. That after we can simply loop over this map to find the unique claim that has no overlap.

== Run solution

Can be run with `python main.py`

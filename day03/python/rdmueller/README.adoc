This solution is written in Python.
This time I will try to make use of class objects.

== First Star

First create a class for the fabric

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=Fabric;!solutionTwo]
....

This class already solved the challenge, I only have to read the input data and ask for the result:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=solutionOne]
....

== Second Star

Since I stored all overlapping IDs already in my data structure,
it should be easy to extract the non overlapping claim with brute force:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=solutionTwo]
....

It takes quite a while but returns after slightly over 2 minutes with the correct answer.
An optimization could be to check for the non-overlap already when the structure is created.

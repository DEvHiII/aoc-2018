This solution is written in Python.

This time I will try to make use of modules.

First, I need a parser for the logs

[source, python]
....
include::logParser.py[]
....

Then I need to transform the logs to a 2D array (list of lists)

[source, python]
....
include::transformer.py[tags=main]
....

Now I can easily count how many minutes every guard is asleep.

I had quite some problems with the python modules - so I gave up on the clean solution and just added the code to calculate the results to the transformer module:

But the test driven development approach really helped me as usual.

== First Star

[source, python]
....
include::transformer.py[tags=starOne]
....

== Second Star

[source, python]
....
include::transformer.py[tags=starTwo]
....

I think for day 5 I wills tay with python, but don't use modules anymore.
A single file as script is enough for these challenges - there seems not to be much reusability.

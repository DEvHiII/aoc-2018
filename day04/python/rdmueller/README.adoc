== First Star

First, I need a parser for the logs

[source, python]
....
include::logParser.py[]
....

Then I need to transform the logs to a 2D array (list of lists)

[source, python]
....
include::transformer.py[]
....

Now I can easily count how many minutes every guard is asleep.

== Part 1

Wow, this was a tougher one. Thought I could finish it quickly before work and took me 70mins to get part 1 done.

One thing that made this more challenging than previous tasks was the increased complexity in interpreting the input data. For this challenge parsing the input data means aggregating multiple lines into one meaningful dataset. For this I introduced the struct `Shift` that represents a single guards shift.

[source, go]
....
include::./solution.go[tags=StructDef]
....

The struct holds the guards ID, date of the shift and the minutes the guard was asleep. For flexibility - not knowing part2 of the puzzle - I stored all minutes the guard was asleep as their integer value in the `Shift.asleep` slice.

For extracting the data from the array of strings (input.txt) I wrote the following helper function that uses the occurence of a guard change to instantiate a new `Shift` struct.

[source, go]
....
include::./solution.go[tags=generateShifts]
....

After the shifts are extracted solution for part 1 (strategy 1) can be visualized as:

IMPORTANT: I got lazy drawing if conditions so please forgive me for simplifying this diagram ðŸ™ƒ

@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:initialize empty //guard:sleepDuration// map;
while (for each //shift//)
  if (on-duty guard was not mapped?) then (y)
    :calculate on-duty guards
    total sleep duration over all shifts;
    :store total sleep duration in map;
  endif
endwhile
while (for each guard in //guard:sleepDuration// map)
  :identify longest sleeping guard;
endwhile
while (for each shift of //longest sleeping guard//)
  while (for minute = 0..59)
    :identify minute with most sleep
    occurences over all shifts;
  endwhile
endwhile
:print result;
end

== Part 2

Having already created the basic array of `Shift` structs the second strategy seemed rather easy to implement.

[plantuml, day04-part2, png]
....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:initialize empty //sleepMap// for
k=guard, v=[60]int, representing minutes 0..59
//where each array value is the count of shifts asleep//
//for the given minute//;
while (for each shift)
  :pouplate the map by inc the array
  at given index for each shift.asleep value;
endwhile
:initialize overall temp vars
for max values (minute, sleepCount, guardId);
while (min = 0..59)
  :init per-minute temp vars#
  sleepCount, guardId;
  while (for each guard in //sleepMap//)
    if (guard slept the most
    at the given //min//) then (y)
      :update per-minute vars;
    endif
  endwhile
  if (per-minute temp vars
  are a new global maximum) then (y)
    :update global maximum if necessary;
  endif
endwhile
:print global maximum sleep count,
guard ID and minute;
end

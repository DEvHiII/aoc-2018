== Solution written in Kotlin

To build and run the tests:

    ./gradlew build

To run:

   ./gradlew run

== Solution

The data is parsed from a text file in `src/main/resources`.

My goal was to familiarize myself more with Kotlin's functional parts. I solved both
parts without a single loop.

=== Part 1

After loading the data and parsing it into a list of `GuardNap` (with time of start and end),
I group the naps by guard and then transform it into a List<SleepHabits>.

The class `SleepHabits` has an instance per guard and contains the following information:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class SleepHabits(val guard: Int,
                       val minuteOfMostNaps: Int,
                       val numberOfNapsAtMinuteOfMostNaps: Int,
                       val totalSleepDuration: Int)
----

The solution of part 1 is the `SleepHabit` with the maximum of `totalSleepDuration`.

=== Part 2

The solution of part 2 is the `SleepHabit` with the maximum of `numberOfNapsAtMinuteOfMostNaps`.

== Advent of Code 2018

My goal for this year's advent of code is to learn python.

Within the gitpod container, python is quite easy to use.
Just prepend the following shebang to your file

.Python shebang
[source,bash]
....
#!/usr/bin/env python3
....

and make the file executable with a `chmod u+x filename.py`.
You can then execute the file as `./filename.py`.

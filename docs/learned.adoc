== Today I learned..

A collection of everyones daily learnings

=== Day 1

[cols="1,10"]
|====
|{anoff}
| .. that Go only has for loops

|{rdmueller}
a| * Elm is a language which seems to compile / transpile to JavaScript

|{robertwalter83}
| I learned how to use List.foldl/foldr in elm

|{gysel}
a| * How to create an infinite, repeating Sequence in Kotlin.
 * There is no map operator that also provides an accumulator in Kotlin (such as http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/scan.html[ReactiveX Scan])

|{tschulte}
a| * How to read a file in JavaScript and split by line ending
   * That JavaScript may implicitly convert a string to a number (e.g. that `1 + "1" == "11"` but `1 * "1" === 1`)
   * How to explicitly convert a string to a number using `Number("1")`
   * That `Number("")` and `Number(null)` both are `0`
   * That `NaN !== NaN`, but you have to use `isNaN(NaN)` instead
|====

=== Day 2

[cols="1,10"]
|====
|{anoff}
| .. all my go projects need to go into `~/go/src`, which solves the dependency link problem for go

|{rdmueller}
a| * Documentation driven development: first write the docs, then do the coding.
Works great on top of test driven development!
* Python has no power-assertions like groovy has. Makes testing harder ðŸ˜’
* VS Code and thus gitlab has a column mode for editing!
* All your tests might run fine but the solution is still wrong

|{gysel}
a| * The zip operator in Kotlin combines two Lists into a List<Pair>>
* It makes sense to return either List or Sequence from your functions depending on the result size (List or Stream in Java)

=== Day 2

|====
|{rdmueller}
a| * how classes work in Python
* Asciidoctor lets you https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tag-filtering[exclude tags] in the `include` statement

== Solution written in elm 0.19

goto https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html to find your elm installation guide

to build:

    elm make src/Main.elm

This should produce index.html in the root directory, which you can open locally (also checked in for convenience).

== Solution

The input is a list of strings.

=== Part 1

The input list is transformed three times.

  . Step: From a *list of strings* to a *list of list of chars*
  . Step: From a *list of list of chars* to a *list of dictionaries*, with *key = letter; value = count*
  . Step: From a *list of dictionaries* to a tuple of two factors, which need to be multiplied in the end to get the checksum

We increase the first factor every time a dictionary contains a value of 2, and we increase the second factor every time a dictionary contains a value of 3.

=== Part 2

Pending.

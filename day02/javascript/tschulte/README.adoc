== First Star

First a string is transformed to a histogram with char as key and count as value

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=histogram]
....

Than we need a function to return 1, if any char in that histogram has a value of n

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=nTimes]
....

And last but not least we put it together

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=checksum]
....

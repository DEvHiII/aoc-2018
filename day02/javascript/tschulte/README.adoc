== First Star

First a string is transformed to a histogram with char as key and count as value

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=histogram]
....

Than we need a function to return 1, if any char in that histogram has a value of n

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=nTimes]
....

And last but not least we put it together

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=checksum]
....

== Second Star

This solution just generates the common string for each combination of rows.
The first common string that is just one char smaller than the two lines is the result.

[source, js]
....
include::part2.js[]
....

Here I learned, that

[source, js]
....
for (i = 0; ...) {}
for (i = 0; ...) {}
....

does not work, and you have to limit the scope of the variables.

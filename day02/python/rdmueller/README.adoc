This solution is written in Python.
This time I will try to make use of test-driven development.

== First Star

Let's first break it down into functions.
One that counts the letters in an id:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=countLetters]
....

And one that builds the checksum:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=createChecksum]
....

With those two functions which are tested with the given aoc examples, the whole problem boild down to a one-liner:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=solutionOne]
....

== Second Star

Let's use the same documentation-/test-driven approach.

This time, we need a distance function:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=calcDistance]
....

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[tags=starTwo]
....

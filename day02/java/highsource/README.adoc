== Solution written in Java

This is just a setup-test. To build:

    mvn clean install

To run:

   java -jar target/aoc-2018-day02-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

== Solution Part 1

The core element is counting letters per line. This can be done with a one-liner with streams:

```
Map<Integer, Long> result = str.chars().boxed().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));
```

== Solution Part 2

Since the number of strings isn't too large, we can just compare them pairwise. Since we're asked about the common part,
we can calculate this right away. Iterate over characters of two strings and if the are equal, add them to the string buffer.

Having this common part calculation routine in place we're simply looking for two strings which have common part with length
exactly 1 smaller than lengths of the strings.

== Part 1

The first part of the challenge requires to remove adjacent characters from a string if they are the same char but different cases e.g. `Aa` or `bB` but not `bb/BB`. My initial approach was to recursively loop over the string and create a new substring that excludes all those matches.

It works but is painfully slow, around `17s` on a MacBook non-pro with the input of `50,000 characters`.

  :initialize slice of strings;
  while (for each char\nat string[i])
    if (string[i] and string[i-1]
    are NOT a matching pair) then (y)
      :append string[i] to new slice;
    endif
  endwhile
  :convert slice to new string;
repeat while (new string is shorter
than previous string)
:print resulting string;
end

== Part 2

For the second part the character removal from part 1 is required again. This time removing all appearances of a specific letter (a..z, lower&uppercase) before running the removal process and evaluating which combination (a..z removed) gives the shortest overall string.

This took `7m 44s` which means I need to learn https://flaviocopes.com/golang-profiling/[how to] https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/[profile] go code.

== Profiling in Go

https://github.com/google/pprof[pprof] has a nice overview on their GitHub page, don't bother reading outdated (sometimes 2011..) blog posts.

=== Prerequisites

[source, bash]
....
brew install graphviz
go get github.com/pkg/profile
go get github.com/google/pprof
....

By adding the following line to the `main()` function a CPU profile will be made.

[source, go]
....
import (
	..
	"github.com/pkg/profile"
)

func main() {
	defer profile.Start().Stop()
  ..
....

=== Running the profiler

After building and running the program `go build` and `cat input.txt |./pipe-reader` the pprof tool can be used to create a visualization of the CPU usage.

[source, bash]
....
# local web server
go tool pprof -http=localhost:8080 ./pipe-reader /var/folders/7s/0pyrdrhd2t18fnmdqggkgy8r0000gn/T/profile108827510/cpu.pprof

# generate svg
go tool pprof -svg ./pipe-reader /var/folders/7s/0pyrdrhd2t18fnmdqggkgy8r0000gn/T/profile108827510/cpu.pprof
....

Main problem seems to be that I iterate over the entire string ~1,500 times. Each time I replicate most of the original string into a slice which means increasingly allocating a slice of up to ~50,000 elements...1,500 times. Doesn't seem smart.

== Refactor

A second idea I had how to solve the problem of removing duplicates was to simply brute-force all combinations and call `strings.Replace` on the combinations.

[plantuml, day05-refactor, png]
....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:read input;
repeat
  while (char a..z)
    :generate uppercase &
    lowercase of char;
    :remove uppercase+lowercase (Aa);
    :remove lowercase+uppercase (aA);
  endwhile
repeat while (new string is shorter
than previous string)
:print resulting string;
end

This now approach - even though not very pretty - gives a significant performance increase. Including on the fly compilation the run now takes `0.5s` compared to the previous `17s` (for part 1). When building the binary in advance it only takes `250ms` to get solution 1 üëØ‚Äç

== Go solution (optimized)

Can be run with `cat input.txt | go run *.go`

[source, go]
....
include::./solution.go[]

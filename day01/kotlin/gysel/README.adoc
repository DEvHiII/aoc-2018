To run:

   ./gradlew run

== Solution

The data is parsed from a text file in `src/main/resources`.

=== Part 1

Simply calculating the sum of a `List<Int>` using https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/sum.html[sum()]

=== Part 2

Generate an infinite Kotlin Sequence (a Sequence is lazy) and iterate until a
frequency is found for the second time. Unfortunately there is no operator in the stdlib
to `map` using an accumulator. I'm therefore using a Closure to access state from outside
of the Lambda.

First I needed to learn how to read a file.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=readFile]
....

After that we need to get the lines,

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=splitLines]
....

and map each line to a number.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=mapToNumber]
....

The last step is to just reduce the input array to the sum of all numbers.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=reduce]
....

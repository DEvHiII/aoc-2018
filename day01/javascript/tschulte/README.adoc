First I needed to learn how to read a file.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=readFile]
....

After that we need to get the lines,

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=splitLines]
....

and map each line to a number.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=mapToNumber]
....

The last step is to just reduce the input array to the sum of all numbers.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=reduce]
....

Here I started to extract the method into it's own module, so I could unit test it.

[source, js]
.Extracted module for part 2
....
include::part2.js[]
....

[source, js]
.Tests
....
include::tests.js[]
....

Interestingly all tests just ran fine, but the result of the test run was wrong. That was, because the code `.filter(line => line)` when converting the lines to numbers was not yet there causing the last line of the input to be parsed as `0`.

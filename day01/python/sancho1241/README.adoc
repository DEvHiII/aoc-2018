So this is my very first Python program. Well... actually my second after "Hello World" ;-)
And my first program after 16 years of non-coding.
No time left today for part 2.
My solution in pseudo code (not pretty smart though):

Add all calculated  frequencies to a list
While duplicate not found
    Read lines from file
    compare calculated frequency with items in the list
    IF CurrentFrequeny is in list
        duplicate found
        print Current Frequency
